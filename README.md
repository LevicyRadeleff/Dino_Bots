Script Function:
This bot will run a script to update a user's dino list to have every dino at a specific number. Original intent is to grant or remove stacks.
   * This can be used to give staff 50 or 1 or 0 of every dinosaur.
This bot can also be used to make balance adjustments accordingly. For example, adding 10k to retiring staff or adding the total cost of a user's dino list when granting stacks.
In addition this can also be used to remove every dinosaur from a member should the need arise.
This script is for use and distribution within the River Den only.
